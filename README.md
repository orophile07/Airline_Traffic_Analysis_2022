✈️ Airline Traffic Analysis – India 2022

📊 Project Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of Airline Traffic Data for various Indian airlines in the year 2022. The dataset used is a real-time dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing 2906 rows of flight-level information. The objective is to derive actionable insights into flight operations, pricing, delays, and customer satisfaction — using Power BI and Excel as primary tools.

🎯 Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:

Analyze flight patterns, pricing strategies, and performance metrics of Indian airlines in 2022.

Identify key operational bottlenecks such as frequent delays and low-rated services.

Provide data-driven insights to support airline management in optimizing scheduling, pricing, and customer satisfaction.

🏢 Business Problem Addressed
Airline operators often face challenges such as:

High variability in flight delays and durations.

Unoptimized pricing strategies leading to reduced competitiveness.

Poor customer experience resulting in low ratings.

This analysis addresses these challenges by:

Revealing total revenue generated per month wise and also average ticket price.

Evaluating the relationship between pricing and cabin class.

Analyzing customer ratings to uncover gaps in service quality.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI – for building interactive dashboards and data visualizations.

Excel – for initial data cleaning and exploration.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – to create custom measures, KPIs, and time-based calculations.

📊 Power BI Insights & Visualizations
The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:

Price comparison across cabin classes and airlines.

Origin-Destination route mapping to visualize flight frequency.

Monthly trends in traffic and delays.

📈 Key Business Insights
Airlines with higher delays tend to have lower customer ratings.

Premium cabin classes are priced up to 2.5x more than economy but don’t always correlate with higher ratings but tends to give the most revenue.

Some carriers consistently maintain on-time performance with above-average customer satisfaction.

📌 Conclusion

Airline executives optimize routes and pricing

Marketing teams identify customer pain points

Operations managers improve scheduling and delay mitigation
